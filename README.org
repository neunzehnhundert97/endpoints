* Endpoints
** What is this
For hobby projects I usually write single page applications which communicate with a REST API. Managing the AJAX endpoints is tedious so I decided to write a solution for it.

This library allows to define endpoints with an input and output type and generate implementations for client and server.

** What about other libraries which do exactly this?
You may know [[https://github.com/lihaoyi/autowire][autowire]] or [[https://endpoints4s.github.io/][endpoints4s]]. There is no particalar reason not to use them, I just could not resist the temptation to write my own solution for the problem. Of course, the other libraries provide more features and less bugs.

If you happen to like the way this library handles things, feel free to try it out.
